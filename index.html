                    <h2>Hi, I'm Tanisha, a software engineer with a love for all things creative.  I enjoy transforming mockups into beautiful layouts while using JavaScript to create a user experience that is intuitive and puts users first.</h2>
                    <p>I'm a recent graduate of the <a href="https://turing.io/" target="_blank">Turing School of Software & Design</a>, a 7 month intensive project-based learning computer programming school. You can view my projects on <a href="https://www.github.com/tanishalatoya" target="_blank">here</a>!</p>
                    <p>Having a background that includes 5 years in the finance/accounting industry and 8 years in the education sector lends itself well to the process and challenges associated with the responsibilities of an engineer. As such, my strongest skillsets include effectively problem-solving, being able to self-start, and designing and optimizing systems.</p>
                    <p>Beyond my technical skills, I am an avid learner, a great communicator, and someone who is great at struggling, which I view as a personal strength.</p>
                    <p>Feel free to contact me to if you're interested in having a teammate that is thoughtful, values collaboration, and is excited about all things programming. Or if you just want to talk tech over chai lattes!</p>
